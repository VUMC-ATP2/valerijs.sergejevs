Information about me

For the past 3 years I have worked as a terminal inspector. But I've always been interested in information technology. I finished the basic software testing courses. We had a practice in testing online applications, writing test cases, drawing up working documentation for testing. Studied to find bugs in applications and worked with a bug tracking system Jira.
Also, I finished C# for Beginners, where I learned how to use Visual Studio and studied process data with MySQL. 
Now, iâ€™m selfstuding with Selenium Webdriver and Java Basics.
